    """
    State for the main chat researcher workflow graph.

    Attributes:
        messages: Conversation history with LangGraph message reducer.
        tools_info: Information about available tools.
        user_info: Optional user information for personalization.
        data_sources: Optional list of user-selected data source IDs.
        research_depth: User-selected source/depth tier for deep research.
        user_intent: Result of intent classification.
        depth_decision: Result of depth routing.
        final_report: The final research report.
        shallow_result: Result from shallow research (if executed).
        clarifier_result: Log from clarifier agent dialog.
        original_query: The latest user query, preserved for deep research.
        available_documents: User-uploaded documents with summaries for context.
        agent_type: Async research agent to submit when deep research is forced.
        force_deep_research: When True, research queries skip shallow routing and
            go directly to deep research. Meta queries are still answered as meta.
        skip_clarifier: When True the clarifier node is bypassed regardless of
            ``enable_clarifier``.  Set automatically for API-key and anonymous
            callers so headless workflows do not stall waiting for user input.
