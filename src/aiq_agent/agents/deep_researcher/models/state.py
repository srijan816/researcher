    State for deep research agent.

    The deepagents-based DeepResearcherAgent manages its own internal state
    through the deepagents library. This state primarily handles the interface
    with the orchestrator.

    Attributes:
        messages: Conversation history with LangGraph message reducer.
        data_sources: List of data sources selected by the user.
        research_depth: User-selected source/depth tier for deep research.
        include_images: Opt-in flag to embed up to three generated images in the final report.
        user_info: Optional user information.
        tools_info: Information about available tools.
        todos: Todo list managed by TodoListMiddleware.
        files: Virtual filesystem managed by FilesystemMiddleware.
        subagents: Status of subagents (planner, researcher) managed by
            SubAgentMiddleware.
        clarifier_result: Log from clarifier agent dialog.
        available_documents: User-uploaded documents with summaries for context.
