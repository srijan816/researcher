# Data Table Analysis Skill

Generate accurate, source-grounded tables and computed quantitative summaries using Python/pandas.
This skill produces text artifacts that can be read and included in the final report.

## Required Execution Standard

To ensure the calculation is reproducible and useful, you MUST:
1. **Structure Inputs:** Convert facts from research notes or the user request into explicit rows before running pandas.
2. **Preserve Provenance:** Keep source URLs, filing names, or note references in the input table when available.
3. **Normalize Units:** Convert currencies, magnitudes, periods, and date labels into consistent fields before comparing values.
4. **Compute Deterministically:** Call the `execute` tool to run Python/pandas for arithmetic, rankings, growth rates, aggregates, and formatting. Do not hand-compute these values in prose.
5. **Write Text Outputs:** Save markdown, CSV, or JSON outputs to `/shared/...` with descriptive filenames using `write_file`.
6. **Report Caveats:** Include assumptions, missing values, restatements, estimated figures, or non-comparable metrics in the output notes.

## Execution Flow

1. Gather candidate facts from researcher outputs, user-provided data, or source excerpts.

2. Create a normalized input table with one row per comparable observation. Prefer explicit CSV or JSON records embedded in the Python script. If the source rows are in `/shared/...`, call `read_file` first and embed the returned content in the script, or write a sandbox-local input file under `/workspace`. Sandbox code cannot open `/shared/...` directly.

3. Call the `execute` tool with a Python command or script that:
   - imports pandas,
   - builds a DataFrame from the normalized rows,
   - validates data types,
   - standardizes units and period labels,
   - computes the requested metrics,
   - prints markdown, CSV, JSON, and data-quality notes as text.
   - uses `/workspace` for any sandbox-local input or output files.
   - does not read from or write to `/shared/...` inside the sandbox process.

4. Inspect the `execute` output. If the code fails, fix the code and call `execute` again. Do not continue with hand-computed fallback tables unless the sandbox or pandas is unavailable.

5. Write final text artifacts from the successful `execute` output to `/shared/...` using `write_file`, for example:
   - `/shared/capex_growth_table.md`
   - `/shared/capex_normalized.csv`
   - `/shared/capex_analysis.json`

6. In the response or report, cite the original sources for the input figures. Computed columns should be clearly labeled as calculations.

**Required Tool Use:** For tasks that request calculated tables, growth rates, rankings, summary statistics, normalization, CSV, or JSON, this skill requires at least one `execute` call that runs Python/pandas before writing the final artifacts.

## Input Normalization Guidelines

| Input Issue | Required Handling |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Mixed magnitudes | Convert millions/billions/trillions into one numeric unit, such as USD billions. |
| Mixed currencies | Convert to one currency only when an exchange-rate source is available; otherwise keep currencies separate and flag the limitation. |
| Fiscal vs. calendar quarters | Preserve the reported fiscal period and add a normalized sortable period field when possible. |
| Company-specific definitions | Keep metric names explicit, such as "capital expenditures", "PP&E additions", or "cash capex". |
| Missing values | Use null/blank values, not zero, unless the source explicitly reports zero. |
| Approximate figures | Mark estimates with an `is_estimate` column or a notes field. |
| Conflicting figures | Keep both rows with source notes unless one source is clearly authoritative. |

## Calculation Specifications

| Calculation | Formula / Logic Guide |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **QoQ Growth** | `(current_value / prior_quarter_value - 1) * 100` within each entity and metric. |
| **YoY Growth** | `(current_value / value_four_quarters_ago - 1) * 100` within each entity and metric. |
| **CAGR** | `(ending_value / beginning_value) ** (1 / years) - 1`, only when periods are comparable. |
| **Ranking** | Sort by the normalized numeric value and include rank ties deterministically. |
| **Share of Total** | `value / group_total * 100`, computed within the relevant period or category. |
| **Summary Stats** | Include count, mean, median, min, max, and missing-value count when useful. |

## Output Formats

The sandbox supports text outputs that should be saved through `/shared/`:
- `.md` - Markdown tables and explanatory notes for report inclusion.
- `.csv` - Normalized tabular data for reuse.
- `.json` - Structured records, assumptions, and summary metrics.

**Storage Note:** Always use descriptive filenames (e.g., ai_capex_8q_growth.md) rather than generic names like output.md.

## Example Code Templates

### A. Normalize Rows and Compute QoQ/YoY

Use this when researched figures need growth calculations.

```python
import pandas as pd

rows = [
    {
        "company": "ExampleCo",
        "period": "FY2025-Q1",
        "period_index": 202501,
        "metric": "capital_expenditures",
        "value_usd_billions": 12.4,
        "source": "https://example.com/filing",
        "notes": "",
    },
]

df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
df = df.sort_values(["company", "metric", "period_index"])
df["qoq_growth_pct"] = (
    df.groupby(["company", "metric"])["value_usd_billions"].pct_change(1) * 100
)
df["yoy_growth_pct"] = (
    df.groupby(["company", "metric"])["value_usd_billions"].pct_change(4) * 100
)

display_cols = [
    "company",
    "period",
    "metric",
    "value_usd_billions",
    "qoq_growth_pct",
    "yoy_growth_pct",
    "source",
    "notes",
]
markdown_table = df[display_cols].to_markdown(index=False, floatfmt=".1f")
csv_text = df[display_cols].to_csv(index=False)
```

### B. Rank Entities by Latest Comparable Period

Use this for company rankings or top-N comparisons.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
latest_period = df["period_index"].max()
latest = df[df["period_index"] == latest_period].copy()
latest = latest.sort_values(
    ["value_usd_billions", "company"],
    ascending=[False, True],
)
latest["rank"] = range(1, len(latest) + 1)

ranking_table = latest[
    ["rank", "company", "period", "value_usd_billions", "source", "notes"]
].to_markdown(index=False, floatfmt=".1f")
```

### C. Generate Data-Quality Notes

Use this to make limitations explicit before synthesis.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
notes = []

missing = df["value_usd_billions"].isna().sum()
if missing:
    notes.append(f"{missing} rows have missing normalized values.")

if "is_estimate" in df.columns and df["is_estimate"].fillna(False).any():
    notes.append("Some values are estimates and should be labeled as such.")

if df.duplicated(["company", "period", "metric"]).any():
    notes.append("Some company-period-metric combinations have multiple source rows.")

data_quality_notes = "\n".join(f"- {note}" for note in notes) or "- No major data-quality issues identified."
```

## Troubleshooting in the Sandbox

- Missing pandas: If `import pandas` fails, report that the sandbox image needs `pandas` installed. Do not hand-compute large tables in prose.
- Sorting Periods: Do not sort fiscal quarters alphabetically. Create a numeric `period_index` or date column.
- Percent Formatting: Keep computed growth as numeric values in CSV/JSON; format percentages only in markdown tables.
- Zero Division: If a prior period is zero or missing, leave growth blank/null and explain the limitation.
