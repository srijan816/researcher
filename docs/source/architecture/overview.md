# Architecture Overview

The NVIDIA AI-Q Blueprint is a multi-agent research system built on the
[NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/index.html).
It uses a two-tier research architecture that keeps simple queries fast while
reserving multi-phase deep research for complex topics.

## System Flow

The following diagram shows the full request lifecycle from user query to
final response. Every query enters through the Intent Classifier, which
decides whether to respond directly (meta), perform a quick tool-augmented
lookup (shallow), or initiate a comprehensive multi-agent investigation (deep).

## Core Components

| Component | Role | Location |
| --------- | ---- | -------- |
| [Intent Classifier](agents/intent-classifier.md) | Single LLM call: classifies intent (meta/research) and depth (shallow/deep) | `agents/chat_researcher/nodes/intent_classifier.py` |
| [Clarifier Agent](agents/clarifier.md) | HITL plan generation and approval before deep research | `agents/clarifier/agent.py` |
| [Shallow Researcher](agents/shallow-researcher.md) | Fast, bounded tool-augmented research | `agents/shallow_researcher/agent.py` |
| [Deep Researcher](agents/deep-researcher.md) | Multi-phase research with planner and researcher subagents | `agents/deep_researcher/agent.py` |
| Chat Researcher Orchestrator | [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview) state machine coordinating all agents | `agents/chat_researcher/agent.py` |

## Orchestrator State Machine

The `ChatResearcherAgent` builds a LangGraph `StateGraph` over `ChatResearcherState` with
four nodes and conditional edges:

```mermaid
graph LR
    IC[intent_classifier] -->|meta| END_NODE[END]
    IC -->|"research/deep"| CL[clarifier]
    IC -->|"research/shallow"| SR[shallow_research]
    SR -->|"escalate"| CL
    SR -->|"done"| END_NODE
    CL --> DR[deep_research]
    DR --> END_NODE

    style IC fill:#fff3e0
    style SR fill:#f3e5f5
    style CL fill:#fce4ec
    style DR fill:#e8eaf6
```

**Routing logic:**

1. **`route_after_orchestration`** -- After the intent classifier runs, the
   graph inspects `state.user_intent.intent`. If `meta`, the response is
   already in `state.messages` and the graph routes to `END`. If `research`,
   it checks `state.depth_decision.decision` to choose `shallow_research` or
   `clarifier`.

2. **`should_escalate`** -- After shallow research completes, the graph
   evaluates whether the response warrants escalation to deep research. It
   checks for empty responses and escalation keywords ("unable to find",
   "need more research", "i don't have enough information") in the last
   800 characters of the AI response. When escalation triggers, the graph
   routes to the `clarifier` node (not directly to `deep_research`), so the
   user can review and approve a plan before deep research begins.
   Escalation is gated by the `enable_escalation` config flag.

## ChatResearcherState

The central state model carries data through the entire workflow:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| `messages` | `list[AnyMessage]` | Conversation history (LangGraph message reducer) |
| `user_info` | `dict` or `None` | Authenticated user information for personalization |
| `data_sources` | `list[str]` or `None` | User-selected data source IDs for tool filtering |
| `user_intent` | `IntentResult` or `None` | Classification result: `meta` or `research` |
| `depth_decision` | `DepthDecision` or `None` | Routing decision: `shallow` or `deep` |
| `final_report` | `str` or `None` | Final report output from deep research |
| `shallow_result` | `ShallowResult` or `None` | Result from shallow research path |
| `clarifier_result` | `str` or `None` | Clarification log and approved plan context |
| `original_query` | `str` or `None` | Preserved user query for deep research |
| `available_documents` | `list[AvailableDocument]` or `None` | User-uploaded documents with summaries |

## Design Decisions

- **Two-tier routing**: Keeps common queries fast (single tool-calling loop)
  while reserving multi-phase deep loops for complex cases. The intent
  classifier makes the routing decision in a single LLM call to minimize
  latency.

- **LangGraph state machine**: Provides explicit, testable routing with
  conversation checkpointing using `InMemorySaver` or persistent backends
  (SQLite, PostgreSQL).

- **Subagent architecture**: Deep research uses specialized subagents (planner,
  researcher) coordinated by an orchestrator, each with their own middleware
  stack and prompt templates.

- **Toolkit-independent agents**: All agents receive dependencies through constructor
  injection for testability. NeMo Agent Toolkit registration is a thin layer in `register.py`
  files.

- **Data source filtering**: Tools are filtered per request based on
  `data_sources`, allowing the same agent to operate over different knowledge
  backends without reconfiguration.

- **Evaluation-driven defaults**: Escalation thresholds and research loop counts
  are tuned through benchmarks (FreshQA, Deep Research Bench) and will evolve
  as evaluation scores improve.

- **Citation verification and auditability**: Every research response passes
  through a deterministic post-processing pipeline that verifies citations
  against actually-retrieved sources, removes unverifiable or unsafe URLs,
  and produces an audit trail of all verification decisions. This is always
  enabled and applies to both shallow and deep research paths. See
  [Deep Researcher -- Citation Verification](agents/deep-researcher.md#phase-5-citation-verification-post-processing)
  for details.
