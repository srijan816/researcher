## Start Here: MiniMax Deep Research

From the repo root, run this single command to start fresh:

```bash
./scripts/run_minimax_deep_research.sh
```

This clears any existing local backend/frontend listeners for this app, verifies the MiniMax/SearXNG/Scrapling workflow dependencies, starts SearXNG if needed, and launches:

- Backend: `http://localhost:9000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Workflow config: `configs/config_cli_minimax_ddgs.yml`

Stop everything later with:

```bash
FORCE_STOP_DEEP_RESEARCH=1 ./scripts/stop_deep_research.sh
```

## Overview

The NVIDIA AI-Q Blueprint is an enterprise-grade research agent built on the [NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/) and uses [LangChain Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview). It gives you both **quick, cited answers** and **in-depth, report-style research** in one system, with benchmarks and evaluation harnesses so you can measure quality and improve over time.

<p align="center">
<img src="./docs/assets/AIQ-arch-light.png" alt="AI-Q Architecture" width="800">
</p>

**Key features:**

- **Orchestration node** — One node classifies intent (meta vs. research), produces meta responses (for example, greetings, capabilities), and sets research depth (shallow vs. deep).
- **Shallow research** — Bounded, faster researcher with tool-calling and source citation.
- **Deep research** — Long-running multi-step planning and research to generate a long-form citation-backed report.
- **Workflow configuration** — YAML configs define agents, tools, LLMs, and routing behavior so you can tune workflows without code changes.
- **Modular workflows** — All agents (orchestration node, shallow researcher, deep researcher, clarifier) are composable; each can run standalone or as part of the full pipeline.
- **Skills and sandbox execution** — Deep research can load built-in DeepAgents skills, including the `data-table-analysis` workflow, and run code-oriented work in a job-scoped Modal sandbox.
- **Portable agent skill** — AI-Q ships `.agents/skills/aiq-research/` so compatible coding harnesses can call a local AI-Q server for routed chat and async deep research jobs.
- **Data source registry** — UI toggles and request payloads can select web, paper, enterprise, collaboration, and knowledge-layer sources per message.
- **Production API and auth** — REST endpoints, async job ownership, token validator entry points, and provider lifecycle hooks support authenticated deployments.
- **Profiling and cost analysis** — Tokenomics reports combine NAT profiler traces with pricing configuration for cost, latency, and cache analysis.
- **Evaluation harnesses** — Built-in benchmarks (for example, FreshQA, DeepResearch) and evaluation scripts to measure quality and iterate on prompts and agent architecture.
- **Frontend options** — Run through CLI, web UI, or async jobs. Refer to [Getting started](#getting-started) and [Ways to run the agents](#ways-to-run-the-agents).
- **Deployment options** - Deployment assets for a [docker compose](deploy/compose/) as well as [helm deployment](deploy/helm/deployment-k8s/).

## Architecture

AI-Q uses a [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)-based state machine with the following key components:

- **Orchestration node**: Classifies intent (meta vs. research), produces meta responses when needed, and sets depth (shallow vs. deep) in one step
- **Shallow research agent**: Bounded tool-augmented research optimized for speed
- **Deep research agent**: Multi-phase research with planning, iteration, and citation management

Each agent can be run individually or as part of the orchestrated workflow. For detailed architecture documentation, refer to [Architecture](docs/source/architecture/overview.md).

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/aiq.git && cd aiq

## Configuration Files

The `configs/` directory holds YAML workflow configs that define agents, tools, LLMs, and routing. Use the one that matches your run mode and data sources:

| Config | Models | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `config_cli_default.yml` | Nemotron 3 Nano 30B, GPT-OSS 120B | CLI default. Web search; optional paper search (requires `SERPER_API_KEY`); no knowledge retrieval. Nemotron Super is commented out but can be enabled for higher quality. |
| `config_web_default_llamaindex.yml` | Nemotron 3 Nano 30B, GPT-OSS 120B, Nemotron Mini 4B | Web default. LlamaIndex knowledge retrieval; web search; optional paper search (requires `SERPER_API_KEY`). Nemotron Super is commented out but can be enabled for higher quality. |
| `config_web_frag.yml` | Nemotron 3 Nano 30B, GPT-OSS 120B | Web + Foundational RAG (external RAG server). Helm default. See [RAG Blueprint](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag/tree/main) for an example RAG deployment. Nemotron Super is commented out but can be enabled for higher quality. |

LlamaIndex; web search; optional paper search (requires `SERPER_API_KEY`). Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Nemotron Super is commented out but can be enabled for higher quality. |

## Ways to Run the Agents

The `frontends/` directory contains different interfaces for interacting with the agents. You can also run agents directly through the NeMo Agent Toolkit CLI.

### Command-line interface (CLI)

The CLI provides an interactive research assistant in your terminal:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run with the convenience script
./scripts/start_cli.sh

# Verbose logging
./scripts/start_cli.sh --verbose

# Or run directly with the NeMo Agent Toolkit CLI (dotenv loads deploy/.env into the environment)
dotenv -f deploy/.env run nat run --config_file configs/config_cli_default.yml --input "How do I install CUDA?"
```

The CLI frontend source is in `frontends/cli/`.

### Web UI

For a full web-based experience:

```bash
./scripts/start_e2e.sh
```

This starts:
- Backend API server at `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend UI at `http://localhost:3000`

The web UI source is in `frontends/ui/`. Refer to [frontends/ui/README.md](frontends/ui/README.md) for more details.

#### Web UI with Docker Compose

You can also run the backend and UI with Docker Compose:

```bash
cd deploy/compose

# No-auth local setup (LlamaIndex default)
docker compose --env-file ../.env -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --build

# To select a different backend config, set BACKEND_CONFIG in deploy/.env, for example:
# BACKEND_CONFIG=/app/configs/config_web_frag.yml
```

For more details, refer to:
- `deploy/compose/README.md`

### Async Deep Research Jobs

Endpoints, SSE streaming, and debug console: refer to [frontends/aiq_api/README.md](frontends/aiq_api/README.md).
For service integrations with MiniMax Deep Research, auth, startup commands, plan approval behavior, and copy-paste client examples, see [docs/deep-research-api.md](docs/deep-research-api.md).

### Benchmarks

To run agents in evaluation mode, refer to the [Evaluating the Workflow](#evaluating-the-workflow) section.

### Jupyter Notebooks

The `docs/notebooks/` directory contains a three-part series that walks through the blueprint from first run to full customization. Run them in order:

| # | Notebook | What it covers | Prerequisites |
|---|----------|----------------|---------------|
| 0 | [Getting Started with AI-Q](docs/notebooks/0_Getting_Started_with_AIQ.ipynb) | Full blueprint overview — environment setup, orchestrated workflow (intent routing, shallow and deep research), and Docker Compose deployment | `NVIDIA_API_KEY`; optionally `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY` |
| 1 | [Deep Researcher — Web Search](docs/notebooks/1_Deep_Researcher_Web_Search.ipynb) | Deep researcher in depth — Python API, `nat run`, and end-to-end evaluation against the DeepResearch Bench with `nat eval` | Notebook 0 completed; `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY`; OpenAI or Gemini key for the judge model |
| 2 | [Deep Researcher — Customization](docs/notebooks/2_Deep_Researcher_Customization.ipynb) | Extending the deep researcher — adding paper search, assigning different LLMs per agent role, editing prompts, and enabling the knowledge layer | Notebooks 0 and 1 completed; `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY` |


## Evaluating the Workflow

The `frontends/benchmarks/` directory contains evaluation pipelines for assessing agent performance.

### Available Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Description | Location |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Deep Research Bench | RACE and FACT evaluation for research quality | `frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/` |
| FreshQA | Factuality evaluation on time-sensitive questions | `frontends/benchmarks/freshqa/` |

### Running Evaluations

### Step 1: Install the dataset

The dataset files are not included in the repository. We have included a script to retrieve them from the [Deep Research Bench Github Repository](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench/tree/main) and format them for the NeMo Agent Toolkit evaluator.

To download the dataset files, run the following script:

```bash
python frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/scripts/download_drb_dataset.py
```

### Step 2: Generate reports using NAT evaluation harness

```bash
dotenv -f deploy/.env run nat eval --config_file frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/configs/config_deep_research_bench.yml
```

### Step 3: Convert the output into a compatible format
```bash
python frontends/benchmarks/deepresearch_bench/scripts/export_drb_jsonl.py --input <path to your workflow_output.json> --output <path to the output file you want to create with .jsonl extension>
```

### Step 4: Run evaluation
Follow instructions in the [Deep Research Bench Github Repository](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench/tree/main) to run evaluation and obtain scores.


### Optional: Phoenix Tracing

If your config enables Phoenix tracing, start the Phoenix server before running `nat eval`.

Start server (separate terminal):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
phoenix serve
```

## Security Considerations

- The AI-Q Blueprint is shared as a reference and is provided "as is". The security in the production environment is the responsibility of the end users deploying it. When deploying in a production environment, please have security experts review any potential risks and threats; define the trust boundaries, implement logging and monitoring capabilities, secure the communication channels, integrate AuthN & AuthZ with appropriate access controls, keep the deployment up to date, ensure the containers/source code are secure and free of known vulnerabilities.
- A robust frontend that handles AuthN & AuthZ is highly recommended. Missing AuthN & AuthZ will result in ungated access to customer models if directly exposed e.g. the internet, resulting in either cost to the customer, resource exhaustion, or denial of service.
- End users are encouraged to add [NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Guardrails) and additional prompt content filtering to the blueprint. Guardrails will be native in upcoming release.
- The AI-Q Blueprint doesn't require any privileged access to the system.
- Deep research skills can invoke sandboxed code execution for analysis workflows. Keep sandbox credentials, quotas, lifecycle cleanup, and network policy aligned with your deployment's trust boundaries.
- End users are responsible for ensuring the availability of their deployment.
- End users are responsible for building, and patching, the container images to keep them up to date.
- The end users are responsible for ensuring that OSS packages used by the developer blueprint are current.
- The logs from middleware, backend, and demo app are printed to standard out. They can include input prompts and output completions for development purposes. The end users are advised to handle logging securely and avoid information leakage for production use cases.
